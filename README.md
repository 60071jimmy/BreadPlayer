###About the project:
This project is being developed to acknowledge and rectify the scarcity of Music players in Windows 10 Store and also to provide flawless and feature-rich Music player to the end-user. It is still in a very **experimental stage** so much so that not even the UI is ready at the moment. The current **alpha-of-the-alpha** version is under heavy development and will undergo thousands of changes before made available to the markets.
###Technologies used:
1. C#/.NET
2. BASS & ManagedBass (for audio processing)
3.
